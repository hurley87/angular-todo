angular-todo
============

This is a simple Todo List I created in Angular(surprise!) which shows off some cool framework features. 

Look at that HTML! 

This demonstrates a reason why Angular is so awesome - custom directives. This allows my html to be more expressive. 
 
 I filter each item based on score. Users can rank each item. 
 
 Used data binding so a user can see their item as they are typing.
 
 Users can check if an item is done and remove that item. 
 
 Make sure you take a look at this is Safari. Using custome directives in Chrome is a bitch.
